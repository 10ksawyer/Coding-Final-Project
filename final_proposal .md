# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

I will likely call it Pong 2.0 or something to that effect.

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

I will use the pong base as a start and then add on to it with power-ups, lives, etc. 

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will create the base pong game using the pong track provided by Professor Rosen. I will then add other features to the base game such as power-ups or lives or anything other things to enhance the game further. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

N/A

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome for my project would be to complete the base pong game and have it be functional with maybe a couple tweaks to enhance it. 

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better outcome would be the base pong game with a couple new features that slightly change the gameplay.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The best outcome would be the base pong game with multiple new features that greatly enhance and change the gameplay.  

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

The first step would be to explore the pong track and begin working on the base game. After that I will begin to explore and brainstorm the new features that I will add and figure out what is possible. I'm not exactly sure of the new skills that I will need to learn at this moment, but I am sure that there are many new skills that I will acquire throughout the creation of the game.
